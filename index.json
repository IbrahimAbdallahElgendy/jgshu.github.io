[{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":" The Earth\u0026rsquo;s solid inner core grows from the solidification of the liquid outer core. The solidification process releases latent heat and expels light elements, providing driving forces for the outer core convection and the geodynamo which generates the Earth\u0026rsquo;s magnetic field. Thus, the information of the Earth\u0026rsquo;s inner core boundary is important for our understanding of the thermo-compositional state of the Earth\u0026rsquo;s core.\nLocalized Mushy ICB  Localized mushy zone at the Earth’s inner core boundary beneath southwest Okhotsk Sea.  (a) PKiKP-PcP travel time residuals, plotted at the PKiKP bouncing points at the ICB, which was excited by seismic source (red star) and recorded by Hi-net stations (black triangles). Positive and negative PKiKP-PcP travel time residuals are denoted by circles and triangles, respectively, with the size of symbols proportional to the absolute value of residuals. (b) Compressional velocity profile of the best-fitting model across the ICB (red line) represented by two parameters: d the thickness of the layer and $\\delta V_P$ percentage compressional velocity jump of the top layer with respect to PREM velocity jump at ICB, along with PREM (black line). (c) Synthetic seismograms for a series of mushy ICB models (red traces, labeled accordingly with two model parameters: $d$ and $\\delta V_P$) and for PREM (bottom black trace). (d) Comparisons of stacked observed PKiKP waveforms (blue traces), which sample the ICB region beneath southwest Okhotsk Sea and synthetic seismograms (red traces) of the best-fitting models. The number of waveforms used in each stacking is labeled at the right of each trace, while the thickness $d$ and percentage compressional velocity jump of the top layer $\\delta V_P$ of the best-fitting models are labeled above the red traces.

We further design two different mechanisms for worker revocation including Server-Local Revocation (SLR) and Global Revocation (GR), which realize efficient worker revocation with minimal overhead on the whole system.

To achieve the accurate task matching, both requesters and workers need to expose their locations or queries to the SC-Server, which raises security concerns. Although many protection measures have been proposed, there are some drawbacks in one-side protection, dual-server setting and user scalability when they are applied to the practical crowdsourcing environment. In this paper, we design a general framework for spatial task matching in a single-server setting to simultaneously protect the privacy for both tasks and workers. Combining multi-user searchable encryption with segment tree, we propose two different schemes to achieve the spatial task matching over the encrypted data.

Existing solutions of task recommendation in crowdsourcing may leak private and sensitive information about both tasks and workers. To protect privacy, information about tasks and workers should be encrypted before being outsourced to the crowdsourcing platform, which makes the task recommendation a challenging problem. In this paper, we propose a privacy-preserving task recommendation scheme (PPTR) for crowdsourcing, which achieves the task-worker matching while preserving both task privacy and worker privacy. In PPTR, we first exploit the polynomial function to express multiple keywords of task requirements and worker interests. Then, we design a key derivation method based on matrix decomposition, to realize the multi-keyword matching between multiple requesters and multiple workers. Through PPTR, user accountability and user revocation are achieved effectively and efficiently. Extensive privacy analysis and performance evaluation show that PPTR is secure and efficient.","tags":[],"title":"Privacy-Preserving Task Recommendation Services for
